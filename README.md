# Smartitecture - Your Windows AI Companion

[![Smartitecture CI](https://github.com/tarun-vignes/Smartitecture/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tarun-vignes/Smartitecture/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml)

Smartitecture is a modern Windows desktop application designed to help everyone better understand their computers, avoid scams, and optimize performance. With its AI-powered assistant, Smartitecture provides natural conversation and system task automation in a simple, accessible interface.

## Technical Overview

Smartitecture is built on .NET 8.0 using a hybrid architecture that combines WinUI 3, WPF, and ASP.NET Core technologies. This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the codebase structure, architecture, and implementation details for developers joining the project.

## Architecture

Smartitecture follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Layers

1. **UI Layer**: WinUI 3 application with XAML-based UI components
2. **Application Layer**: Business logic, services, and application workflows
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and interfaces
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: External service implementations, data access, and platform-specific code

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: UI architecture pattern using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- **Mediator Pattern**: Using MediatR for request/response workflows and decoupled communication
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for service resolution
- **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating system operations and user actions

## Key Technologies

### UI Framework
- **WinUI 3**: Modern native UI framework for Windows applications
- **Windows App SDK**: Provides access to Windows platform features
- **WPF Integration**: For compatibility with existing WPF components
- **Windows Forms Integration**: For specific system integration scenarios

### Backend Services
- **ASP.NET Core**: For hosting internal API endpoints
- **Azure OpenAI SDK**: For AI-powered features and natural language processing
- **System.Management**: For WMI access to system information

### Architecture & Patterns
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: MVVM implementation with source generators
- **MediatR**: For implementing the mediator pattern
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**: IoC container
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting**: For background service hosting

## Core Components

### API Host Service

The `ApiHostService` class hosts an ASP.NET Core web server within the desktop application, enabling:
- Local API endpoints for web-based components
- Integration with web technologies
- Communication with external services

```csharp
public class ApiHostService : IDisposable
{
    // Hosts an ASP.NET Core web server within the desktop application
    // Manages API endpoints for internal and external communication
}
```

### Security Monitoring

The `SecurityMonitorService` provides comprehensive security monitoring:
- Windows Defender status monitoring
- Suspicious process detection
- Security recommendations
- Malware scanning integration

```csharp
public class SecurityMonitorService
{
    // Monitors system security status
    // Provides security recommendations
    // Detects suspicious activities
}
```

### LLM Integration

The `ILLMService` interface and implementations provide AI capabilities:
- Natural language processing
- Command parsing and execution
- Context-aware responses
- Integration with Azure OpenAI

```csharp
public interface ILLMService
{
    // Processes natural language input
    // Generates responses based on context
    // Extracts commands from user input
}
```

### Command System

The command system uses a combination of the Command and Mediator patterns:
- `CommandMapper`: Maps natural language to executable commands
- `ISystemCommand`: Interface for all system commands
- Command handlers: Implement specific system operations

## Namespace Structure

The project recently transitioned from the `AIPal` namespace to `Smartitecture`. To maintain compatibility, namespace aliases are used:

```csharp
// In NamespaceFixup.cs and GlobalUsings.cs
using AIPal = Smartitecture;
using AIPal.API = Smartitecture.Application.API;
using AIPal.Application = Smartitecture.Application;
// Additional namespace aliases...
```

## Testing

The `Smartitecture.Tests` project contains unit and integration tests:
- Command tests: Verify command execution logic
- Security tests: Validate security monitoring features
- Service tests: Test core application services

Tests use:
- **xUnit**: Testing framework
- **Moq**: Mocking library for isolating components

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarun-vignes/Smartitecture.git
   cd Smartitecture
   ```

2. **Install Prerequisites**
   - Install Visual Studio 2022 with required workloads
   - Install .NET SDK 8.0 or later
   - Install Windows App SDK 1.4 or later

3. **Configure Azure OpenAI (if using AI features)**
   - Create an Azure OpenAI resource
   - Configure the connection in `appsettings.json` or user secrets

4. **Build the Solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio
   - Set Smartitecture as the startup project
   - Press F5 to run in debug mode

### Project Configuration

#### appsettings.json

The application uses `appsettings.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "AzureOpenAI": {
    "Endpoint": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/",
    "DeploymentName": "your-deployment",
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key"
  },
  "ApiHost": {
    "Port": 5000,
    "EnableCors": true
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

#### User Secrets (Development)

For local development, use user secrets to store sensitive information:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init --project Smartitecture/Smartitecture.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ApiKey" "your-api-key" --project Smartitecture/Smartitecture.csproj
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Errors

##### Namespace Conflicts

The project recently transitioned from `AIPal` to `Smartitecture` namespace. If you encounter namespace conflicts:

1. Check `NamespaceFixup.cs` and `GlobalUsings.cs` for proper namespace aliases
2. Ensure using directives are correctly formatted (use `using AIPal = Smartitecture;` not `global using alias`)
3. Verify that all project references are correctly set up

##### Runtime Identifier Issues

If you encounter runtime identifier errors:

1. Ensure `Directory.Build.props` has the correct runtime identifiers:
   ```xml
   <RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x86;win-x64;win-arm64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
   ```
2. Verify that project files use the same runtime identifiers
3. Clean and rebuild the solution

##### WinUI and WPF Integration Issues

When working with both WinUI and WPF:

1. Use the correct Application class with full namespace qualification
2. Use namespace aliases to avoid conflicts (e.g., `WinUIApplication` vs `WPFApplication`)
3. Ensure all required framework references are included

#### Runtime Issues

##### API Host Service Not Starting

If the internal API server doesn't start:

1. Check if the port is already in use
2. Verify that ASP.NET Core dependencies are correctly referenced
3. Check for firewall restrictions

##### Azure OpenAI Connection Issues

If AI features aren't working:

1. Verify Azure OpenAI configuration in appsettings.json
2. Check API key and endpoint URL
3. Ensure the deployment name is correct
4. Verify network connectivity to Azure services
