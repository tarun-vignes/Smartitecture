# Smartitecture - AI-Powered Windows Automation

[![Smartitecture CI](https://github.com/tarun-vignes/Smartitecture/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tarun-vignes/Smartitecture/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml)

Smartitecture is a modern Windows automation platform that combines the power of local AI with native Windows automation. The application features a clean, intuitive interface for executing natural language commands and automating Windows tasks with the power of local LLMs (Ollama).

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Local AI Integration**: Powered by Ollama for private, offline AI processing
- **Natural Language Commands**: Control your Windows PC using everyday language
- **Native Windows Automation**: Built with C# for seamless Windows integration
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark/light theme support

## Technical Overview

Smartitecture uses a streamlined architecture:
- **Frontend**: C# WPF (.NET 8.0) with MVVM pattern
- **AI Backend**: Local Ollama LLM integration
- **Automation**: Native Windows APIs for reliable task automation
- **Deployment**: Self-contained single-file executable for Windows

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

### Frontend (C# WPF)
- **.NET 8.0**: Modern, high-performance .NET runtime
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Native Windows UI framework
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of UI and business logic
- **XAML**: Declarative UI definition with modern styling

### AI & Automation
- **Ollama**: Local LLM for natural language processing
- **Windows API**: Native Windows automation
- **System.Management**: System information and monitoring
- **System.Drawing**: Screenshot and image processing

### Architecture & Patterns
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: MVVM implementation with source generators
- **MediatR**: For implementing the mediator pattern
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**: IoC container
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting**: For background service hosting

## Core Components

### API Host Service

The `ApiHostService` class hosts an ASP.NET Core web server within the desktop application, enabling:
- Local API endpoints for web-based components
- Integration with web technologies
- Communication with external services

```csharp
public class ApiHostService : IDisposable
{
    // Hosts an ASP.NET Core web server within the desktop application
    // Manages API endpoints for internal and external communication
}
```

### Security Monitoring

The `SecurityMonitorService` provides comprehensive security monitoring:
- Windows Defender status monitoring
- Suspicious process detection
- Security recommendations
- Malware scanning integration

```csharp
public class SecurityMonitorService
{
    // Monitors system security status
    // Provides security recommendations
    // Detects suspicious activities
}
```

### LLM Integration

The `ILLMService` interface and implementations provide AI capabilities:
- Natural language processing
- Command parsing and execution
- Context-aware responses
- Integration with Azure OpenAI

```csharp
public interface ILLMService
{
    // Processes natural language input
    // Generates responses based on context
    // Extracts commands from user input
}
```

### Command System

The command system uses a combination of the Command and Mediator patterns:
- `CommandMapper`: Maps natural language to executable commands
- `ISystemCommand`: Interface for all system commands
- Command handlers: Implement specific system operations

## Namespace Structure

The project recently transitioned from the `AIPal` namespace to `Smartitecture`. To maintain compatibility, namespace aliases are used:

```csharp
// In NamespaceFixup.cs and GlobalUsings.cs
using AIPal = Smartitecture;
using AIPal.API = Smartitecture.Application.API;
using AIPal.Application = Smartitecture.Application;
// Additional namespace aliases...
```

## Testing

The `Smartitecture.Tests` project contains unit and integration tests:
- Command tests: Verify command execution logic
- Security tests: Validate security monitoring features
- Service tests: Test core application services

Tests use:
- **xUnit**: Testing framework
- **Moq**: Mocking library for isolating components

## Build Configuration

The solution uses MSBuild with custom configuration in `Directory.Build.props`:

   - Install .NET SDK 8.0 or later
   - Install Windows App SDK 1.4 or later

3. **Configure Azure OpenAI (if using AI features)**
   - Create an Azure OpenAI resource
   - Configure the connection in `appsettings.json` or user secrets

4. **Build the Solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio
   - Set Smartitecture as the startup project
   - Press F5 to run in debug mode

### Project Configuration

#### appsettings.json

The application uses `appsettings.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "AzureOpenAI": {
    "Endpoint": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/",
    "DeploymentName": "your-deployment",
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key"
  },
  "ApiHost": {
    "Port": 5000,
    "EnableCors": true
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

#### User Secrets (Development)

For local development, use user secrets to store sensitive information:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init --project Smartitecture/Smartitecture.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ApiKey" "your-api-key" --project Smartitecture/Smartitecture.csproj
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Errors

##### Namespace Conflicts

The project recently transitioned from `AIPal` to `Smartitecture` namespace. If you encounter namespace conflicts:

1. Check `NamespaceFixup.cs` and `GlobalUsings.cs` for proper namespace aliases
2. Ensure using directives are correctly formatted (use `using AIPal = Smartitecture;` not `global using alias`)
3. Verify that all project references are correctly set up

##### Runtime Identifier Issues

If you encounter runtime identifier errors:

1. Ensure `Directory.Build.props` has the correct runtime identifiers:
   ```xml
   <RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x86;win-x64;win-arm64</RuntimeIdentifiers>
   ```
2. Verify that project files use the same runtime identifiers
3. Clean and rebuild the solution

##### WinUI and WPF Integration Issues

When working with both WinUI and WPF:

1. Use the correct Application class with full namespace qualification
2. Use namespace aliases to avoid conflicts (e.g., `WinUIApplication` vs `WPFApplication`)
3. Ensure all required framework references are included

#### Runtime Issues

##### API Host Service Not Starting

If the internal API server doesn't start:

1. Check if the port is already in use
2. Verify that ASP.NET Core dependencies are correctly referenced
3. Check for firewall restrictions

##### Azure OpenAI Connection Issues

If AI features aren't working:

1. Verify Azure OpenAI configuration in appsettings.json
2. Check API key and endpoint URL
3. Ensure the deployment name is correct
4. Verify network connectivity to Azure services
